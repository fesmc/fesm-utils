# Changelog

All notable changes to fesm-utils are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **tsgen** (time-series generator): transient scalar forcing driven by time
  and/or model response. Time-driven methods (`const`, `ramp-time`,
  `ramp-time-step`, `ramp-slope`, `sin`) evaluate an analytic series;
  response-driven methods (`exp`, `PI42`, `H312b`, `H312PID`, `H321PID`,
  `PID1`) run stateful feedback controllers. Includes `tsgen_tabulate` /
  `tsgen_write` diagnostics and a `make test-tsgen` self-check. Supersedes the
  former (unbuilt) `hyster` module.

## [v1.2] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **coords/mapping subsystem** (major): coordinate geometry, projections
  (oblimap, rotated-pole), Gaussian-latitude grids, and an array-backed kdtree.
- **Weight-map remapping**: nearest-neighbour, bilinear, and conservative
  kernels with SCRIP-superset weight-map file I/O (read/write + round-trip).
- **CDO interop**: read/write cdo grid descriptions, online cdo map generation,
  and cached grid→grid maps (load-if-exists, save-on-generate).
- **Multigrid coupler**: coupling layer over coords mapping (grid registry,
  lazy map cache, remap).
- Package-wide constants module; ncio informative errors, vector attributes,
  and transpose helpers; nml defaults overlay + validation.

### Changed
- **Flattened layout**: `utils/` hoisted to repo root; `fftw/`, `lis/`, `SHTns/`
  nested under container dirs.
- **Build**: configme + `make`-driven build replaces `build.py`; SHTns added as
  a build component.
- netCDF4 output now defaults to deflate level 1 (lower memory use).

### Performance
- Parallelized conservative weight generation and `weight_map_apply`.
- Analytic separable weights and structured grid-locate fast paths.
- Removed per-target allocation in apply (~10× faster remap).

### Fixed
- Conservative maps for descending-lat and cross-system (projected) targets;
  non-monotonic (lon180-wrapped) source longitude axes.
- ncio stack-temp overflow on large 3-D writes.

## [v1.1] - 2026-06-18

- Config cleanup (many configs moved to `config/legacy/`).
- Unified `build.py` driver with per-machine TOML configs.
- nml/ncio robustness fixes; lis 2.1.11 with autotools modernized for icx/ifx.

## [v0.1.1] - 2025-03-20

- `varslice`: make `get_matching_files` public; subgrid allocation fixes.

## [v0.1] - 2025-03-06

- Initial import from `climber-x-exlib`.
